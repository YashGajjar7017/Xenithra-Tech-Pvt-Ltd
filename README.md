<h2>🔥 What is Xenithra?</h2>

Xenithra is a next-generation compiler-style code editor designed to be
dramatically faster than VS Code, with near-instant startup, minimal RAM usage, and zero unnecessary bloat.

🧠 Think of VS Code as a loaded SUV — Xenithra is a Formula-1 car.

<ul>🧬 Why Xenithra Exists</ul>

Modern editors are powerful — but heavy.
They trade speed for plugins, memory, and background services.

Xenithra flips the equation:

Traditional Editors	Xenithra
Slow startup	⚡ Instant launch
High RAM usage	🧠 Minimal footprint
Plugin overload	🎯 Focused core
Lag on large files	🚀 Smooth at scale
✨ Core Features

⚡ Performance-First

Lightning-fast cold start

No background memory leaks

Handles large files effortlessly

🧠 Smart Core

Compiler-inspired execution model

Predictive parsing (no unnecessary re-rendering)

Clean, minimal internal architecture

🎨 Modern UI

Sleek minimal interface

Dark-mode native

Zero distraction design

🛠 Developer Focused

Keyboard-first workflow

Fast navigation

Clean project structure handling

🚀 Performance Snapshot (example)
Metric	VS Code	Xenithra
Cold Start	~2.5s	< 300ms
RAM Usage (Idle)	~400MB	< 90MB
Large File Open	Laggy	Instant

⚠️ Benchmarks vary by system — Xenithra is built to scale down, not up.

🧠 Now Think Deeper

What specific workflows should Xenithra outperform VS Code in first?

Do you want this editor to be plugin-light or plugin-controlled?

Should speed be achieved via native bindings, Rust/C++ core, or JS optimization?

If you want, next we can:

make a logo + branding

design a landing page

add real benchmark automation

convert this into a company-grade open-source project
